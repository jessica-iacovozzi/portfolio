  "me_description": "I'm a full-stack developer from Canada who loves using technology to make a positive impact in the world. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a desire to solve complex problems, always striving to learn and grow. When I'm not coding, you might find me watching stand-up comedies, horror movies or wasting time on my phone... I cherish spending quality time with my family and my partner, enjoying the little moments together. I'm also an avid reader, always on the lookout for my next great book. I made this website to showcase my personal projects. Hope you like it!",
